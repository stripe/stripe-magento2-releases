# Installing the Stripe app for Adobe Commerce

## Overview

This guide walks you through installing the Stripe app for **Adobe Commerce** via the Adobe Exchange marketplace. The app integrates Stripe's payment processing with Adobe Commerce to support modern, secure, out-of-process payment processing; without modifying your core Commerce application. Instead of installing modules directly into the codebase (in-process extensibility), it supports out-of-process extensibility using Adobe App Builder. These apps run securely and independently in Adobe I/O Runtime and integrate with your [Adobe Commerce Storefront](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/developer/commerce/storefront/) via the GraphQL APIs and Adobe I/O events.

## Supported platforms

The Stripe app currently supports Adobe Commerce as a Cloud Service (SaaS). Support for Adobe Commerce on cloud infrastructure (PaaS) and Adobe Commerce on-premises is coming very soon.

## Before you begin

### Set up Adobe Commerce as a Cloud Service

Before you begin, you will first need to have an instance of Adobe Commerce as a Cloud Service running. You can create one by:

1. Navigating to [Experience Cloud Console](https://experience.adobe.com/)
1. Under **Quick Access**, click **Commerce**
1. At the top right hand side of the page, click **Add instance**

If you are testing the app on a sandbox / development environment, you can import [available sample data](https://github.com/slamech/commerce-sample-data) from Adobe to your Commerce instance.

### Set up your Stripe account

You can register for a Stripe account via [Stripe's website](https://dashboard.stripe.com/register). After registering, you can access your Stripe API keys via:

- Test Mode: [https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys)
- Live Mode: [https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys)

### Set up App Builder

#### Obtain a license

You will need a [license for App Builder](https://developer.adobe.com/app-builder/docs/get_started/app_builder_get_started/set-up#access-and-credentials) in order to deploy the app. App Builder is necessary so that you can configure IMS authentication credentials, configure Commerce I/O Events, persist data to Adobe I/O Lib Files, or generate encryption keys for your environment file.

You can sign up to a trial of App Builder via [https://developer.adobe.com/app-builder/trial/](https://developer.adobe.com/app-builder/trial/).

#### Create the project

Once you have an App Builder license, navigate to [Adobe Developer Console](https://developer.adobe.com/console/). You should see there a **Create project from template**
button, indicating that your App Builder license is active:

![Create project from template](img/create-project-from-template.png)

Click on the **Create project from template** button, and select App Builder as a template:

![Select App Builder template](img/app-builder-setup1.png)

Fill the project details and click save:

![Fill project details](img/app-builder-setup2.png)

#### Add necessary APIs to the project

1. Select an environment, such as **Stage** or **Production**, click the **Add service** button, and then select **API**.

   ![Add service](img/add-service.png)

1. Select **Adobe I/O Events for Adobe Commerce** and add it to the environment.

1. Repeat the same steps, and add the **I/O Management API** to the environment.

   ![I/O Management API](img/management-api.png)

#### Set up your local environment

Before you can deploy the app to App Builder, you will additionally need to install **Node.js** and the **Adobe I/O CLI** package.
Please follow [the official instructions](https://developer.adobe.com/app-builder/docs/get_started/app_builder_get_started/set-up#local-environment-setup) to set up your local environment.

## Install the App via Adobe Exchange Marketplace

To install the Stripe app, follow the steps below:

1. Navigate to the app's listing on the [Adobe Exchange Marketplace](https://exchange.adobe.com/apps/browse/ec?appType=ABD&listingType=applications&page=1&partnerLevel=All&product=COMMC&q=stripe&sort=RELEVANCE)
1. Click on the app listing to view it.
1. At the top right hand side, click the **Free** button and follow the instructions to install the app into your organization's environment.
1. The app will appear under [Adobe Exchange App Management](https://exchange.adobe.com/manage). If you are an account admin, click the **Review** button on the app page in order to approve it.
1. At the app's page, you will see a **Download Code** button at the top bar. Click it to download the app's code locally. You will need the code to set up your OAuth Credentials.
   ![Download Code](img/download-code.png)
1. Extract the downloaded code to a local directory, and use the CLI to run the following commands:

   ```sh
   aio login -f
   aio console org select
   aio console project select
   aio console workspace select
   aio app use --merge
   ```

1. Confirm that the `.env` and `.aio` files were added to the project directory. Inside `.env`, you will find your OAuth credentials, which are needed for the app to communicate with the Adobe Commerce Admin API:

   ```env
   AIO_ims_contexts_aio__123456789_client__id=
   AIO_ims_contexts_aio__123456789_client__secrets=
   AIO_ims_contexts_aio__123456789_technical__account__email=
   AIO_ims_contexts_aio__123456789_technical__account__id=
   AIO_ims_contexts_aio__123456789_scopes=
   AIO_ims_contexts_aio__123456789_ims__org__id=
   ```

   Copy the values of these fields into the following newly added fields:

   ```env
   OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=
   OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRETS=
   OAUTH_TECHNICAL_ACCOUNT_ID=
   OAUTH_TECHNICAL_ACCOUNT_EMAIL=
   OAUTH_IMS_ORG_ID=
   OAUTH_SCOPES=
   ```

   The above statically named values will be read by the app's runtime actions, in order to create access tokens for the Adobe Commerce Admin API.

1. Generate and add encryption keys for sensitive credentials by running the following command:

   ```sh
   npm run generate-encryption-key
   ```

   The command will output two environment variables which you need to add to your `.env` file:

   ```env
   ENCRYPTION_KEY=
   ENCRYPTION_IV=
   ```

1. Install app dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

1. Deploy the updated app:

   ```sh
   aio app deploy
   ```

## Stripe Configuration

## Add Stripe to your EDS storefront

You can add the Stripe payment method at the checkout page of your EDS storefront by utilizing a pre-build EDS block,
which includes all functionality needed to render the payment form, collect the payment and place the order.

You can find this EDS block inside the source code of the downloaded code, that you downloaded from the marketplace
while installing the app. The EDS block is located under `blocks/stripe-payment/`, and instructions on how to
integrate it with your EDS storefront can be found inside `blocks/stripe-payment/README.md`.
